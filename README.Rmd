## Overview

<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TimTeaFan/loopurrr/main/man/figures/logo_big.png"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TimTeaFan/loopurrr/main/man/figures/logo.png" alt="loopurrr's logo a cat sleeping in the form of a circle" align="right"></a>

The goal of {loopurrr} is to make {purrr}'s iterator functions more understandable and easier to debug.

In this initial version, {loopurrr} consists only of *one* main function: `as_loop()`.

`as_loop()` takes a function call to one of {purrr}'s iterator functions, such as `purrr::map()`, and
translates it into a regular `for` loop.

You might ask: *"Why would anyone want to do this?!"*

`as_loop()` has at least three use cases:

#### Learning and Teaching Functional Programming


#### Debugging


#### Extension of Existing Functions


...


## Installation

{loopurrr} is not on CRAN yet. You can install the latest version from 
[GitHub](https://github.com/TimTeaFan/loopurrr) with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("TimTeaFan/loopurrr")
```

## Getting started

## Supported functions

Currently the following iterator functions from the {purrr} package are supported:

```{r, comment = "#>", collapse = TRUE, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
devtools::load_all()
get_supported_fns("as_loop")
```


## Roadmap and Collaboration

For future versions of {loopurrr} the following milestones are planned:

- release {loopurrr} on CRAN
- support even more iterator functions from {purrr} (e.g. `cross` etc.)
- support base R's `apply` family in `as_loop()`
- translate {purrr}'s iterators to base R equivalents with `as_base()`

If anyone is interested in collaborating on one or more of those milestones, any help is appreciated!
Feel free to reach out to me.
