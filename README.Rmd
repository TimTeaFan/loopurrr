{loopurrr} makes {purrr}'s iterator functions more understandable and easier to debug.

In this initial version, {loopurrr} consists only of *one* main function: `as_loop()`.

`as_loop()` takes a function call to one of {purrr}'s iterator functions, such as `purrr::map()`, and
translates it into a regular `for` loop.

You might ask: *"Why would anyone want to do this?!"* ðŸ˜²ðŸ˜®

`as_loop()` has at least three use cases: ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€

#### 1. Learning and Teaching Functional Programming
Beginners, and especially users new to functional-style programming often have a hard time getting their 
head around R's rather opaque iterator functions, such as base R's `lapply()` or `purrr::map()`.
`for` loops, on the other hand, are fairly well understood, even by users new to R. 

`as_loop()` translates a function call to one of {purrr}'s iterator functions into a regular `for` loop.
Through this `as_loop()` shows how {purrr}'s iterator functions work under the hood. After reading about
what iterator functions do (for example [here](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/iteration.html#the-map-functions)),
LearneRs can start playing around with calling `as_loop()` on the examples in the {purrr} documentation.
TeacheRs, on the other hand, can use `as_loop()` interactively when introducing the different types of
iterator functions in the {purrr} package.


#### 2. Debugging
Once learneRs know what an iterator function does and how to use it, the next hurdle to take is dealing
with failure. Iterator functions introduce an additional layer of complexity, because special knowledge
is required to debug non-running code. By translating an iterator function into a regular `for` loop,
`as_loop()` can help debug functions. When a `for` loop is executed in the global environment it will run
over an index, for example `i`. Once the code throws an error, useRs can easily inspect the code at
index `i` without any special knowledge of how to use a debugger, `browser()` or `purrr::safely()`.
Of course, useRs are highly encouraged to learn how to use R's and {purrr}'s debugging tools and 
functions. However, in data science teams with different levels of programming knowledge, the
possibility to translate complex iterator functions to regular `for` loops can help mitigate 
knowledge gaps.


#### 3. Accessing and Extending {purrr} Functions

## Installation

{loopurrr} is not on CRAN yet. You can install the latest version from 
[GitHub](https://github.com/TimTeaFan/loopurrr) with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("TimTeaFan/loopurrr")
```

## Getting started

...

First, lets use `get_supported_fns("as_loop")` to get a glimpse of what iterator functions from the
{purrr} package are currently supported by `as_loop()`:

```{r, comment = "#>", collapse = TRUE, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
devtools::load_all() # library(loopurrr)
get_supported_fns("as_loop")
```




## Roadmap and Collaboration

For future versions of {loopurrr} the following milestones are planned:

- release {loopurrr} on CRAN
- support even more iterator functions from {purrr} (e.g. `cross` etc.)
- support base R's `apply` family in `as_loop()`
- translate {purrr}'s iterators to base R equivalents with `as_base()`

If anyone is interested in collaborating on one or more of those milestones, any help is appreciated!
Feel free to reach out to me.
