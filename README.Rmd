{loopurrr} makes {purrr}'s iterator functions more understandable and easier to debug.

In this initial version, {loopurrr} consists only of *one* main function: `as_loop()`.

`as_loop()` takes a function call to one of {purrr}'s iterator functions, such as `purrr::map()`, and
translates it into a regular `for` loop.

You might ask: *"Why would anyone want to do this?!"* ðŸ˜²ðŸ˜®

`as_loop()` has at least three use cases:

#### Learning and Teaching Functional Programming
Beginners, and especially users new to functional-style programming often have a hard time getting their 
head around R's rather opaque iterator functions. `for` loops, on the other hand, are fairly well
understood, even by users new to R. 

`as_loop` translates a function call to one of {purrr}'s iterator functions into a regular `for` loop.
By this it makes visible how {purrr}'s iterator functions work under the hood. After reading about
what iterator functions do, LearneRs can start playing around with calling `as_loop()` on the
examples in the {purrr} documentation. TeacheRs can use `as_loop()` interactively when introducing
the different types of iterator functions in the {purrr} package.


#### Debugging
Once you know what an iterator function does and how to use it, the next hurdle to take is dealing
with ...

## Installation

{loopurrr} is not on CRAN yet. You can install the latest version from 
[GitHub](https://github.com/TimTeaFan/loopurrr) with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("TimTeaFan/loopurrr")
```

## Getting started

## Supported functions

Currently the following iterator functions from the {purrr} package are supported:

```{r, comment = "#>", collapse = TRUE, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
devtools::load_all()
get_supported_fns("as_loop")
```


## Roadmap and Collaboration

For future versions of {loopurrr} the following milestones are planned:

- release {loopurrr} on CRAN
- support even more iterator functions from {purrr} (e.g. `cross` etc.)
- support base R's `apply` family in `as_loop()`
- translate {purrr}'s iterators to base R equivalents with `as_base()`

If anyone is interested in collaborating on one or more of those milestones, any help is appreciated!
Feel free to reach out to me.
