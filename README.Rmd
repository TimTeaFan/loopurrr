## About

This branch creates the "Twitter Like Social Badge" as displayed above. The badge shows the number of
likes the [tweet that announced the loopurrr package](https://twitter.com/timteafan/status/1511034067344572422?s=21&t=WEhGBqj-5dtsFIYCuAtmpg) 
has received so far.

This README documents how I built the badge using shields.io and Github Action. This is not only for
my future self (who won't remember), but also for anyone who is interested in building a similar badge.

The setup consists of four steps:

1. sign up for the Twitter API
2. get the number of likes of a specific Tweet
3. build a GitHub Actions workflow that gets the Twitter data and saves it to a dedicated branch
4. add an image based on a dynamic shields.io URL to the README


#### 1. Twitter Developer Plattform

This step was pretty straightforward: just sign up [here](https://developer.twitter.com). Since the 
number of likes of a Tweet can be accessed via the API v2, "essential access" is enough - we do not
need to apply for the more restrictive "elevated access".


#### 2. The Twitter API

Looking at the [docs](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/likes/introduction) I
thought `GET /2/tweets/:id/liking_users` would be the way to go about it, but this returns a list of
all user names, whereas I only needed the number of likes. The following was what I was looking for:

`GET /2/tweets?ids=<tweetID>&tweet.fields=public_metrics`

Originally I wanted to use the {rtweet} package, but realizing that I only need one command to get
the data I figured a call to `curl` from the command line was enough for my needs, especially since
we can save the output with `curl <URL> -o my.file`


#### 3. Github Actions

This was the toughest part. Up until now I just used existing #RStats Github Action Workflows like RMD
Check or pkgdown. They were easy to set up, but looking at the YAML I had no idea how to customize
them further, let alone create one from scratch. First, I started with the OS. Since I use a Mac at
home I chose: `runs-on: macOS-latest` to be able to test single steps in a similar environment
I later switched this to `ubuntu-latest`).

Next, I wanted to run the workflow on a dedicated branch. To do this we need `uses: actions/checkout@v3`
because from version 3 on we can specify

```{yaml, eval = FALSE}
with:
    ref: mybranch
```

Since I later wanted to commit and push the data, it was necessary to set-up git first (thanks to
[@Lluis_Revilla's help](https://twitter.com/lluis_revilla/status/1524805074337288194?s=21&t=WEhGBqj-5dtsFIYCuAtmpg) on this)

```{yaml, eval = FALSE}
run: |
  git config user.email github-actions@guthub.com
  git config user.name github-actions`
```

Getting the actual data from Twitter is just one call to curl. Here I wasn’t sure how to access the
Bearer Token but looking at other workflows helped a lot:

```{sh, eval = FALSE}
curl 'https://api.twitter.com/2/tweets?ids=1511034067344572422&tweet.fields=public_metrics&expansions=attachments.media_keys&media.fields=public_metrics' --header 'Authorization: Bearer ${{ secrets.TWITTER_BEARER_TOKEN }}' -o likes
```

Finally, I wanted to commit and push the data. This yielded an error in cases, where there was no
change to the data. I found the following helpful command:

```{sh, eval = FALSE}
git diff-index --quiet HEAD || (git commit -a -m'[bot]: update latest twitter likes data' --allow-empty && git push -f)`
```

Apparently we can just use Boolean operators. I’m not exactly sure how the single elements evaluate,
but it seems like: Either there is no difference between the latest commit and the working tree or
commit and push.

After figuring out how to run the job, I scheduled it to be executed every 12 hours: `'0 */12 * * *'`

The whole YAML script can be found [here](https://github.com/TimTeaFan/loopurrr/blob/main/.github/workflows/like-badge.yaml).


#### 4. shields.io

The final step was to create a dynamic [shields.io](https://shields.io) badge. Here the only tricky
part was the "query" specification. It helped to transform the json file from the Twitter API into
an R list object and subset it to get the likes:

`data[[1]]$public_metrics$like_count` in R corresponds to `.data..public_metrics.like_count`.

This is the full URL:

`https://img․shields․io/badge/dynamic/json?url=https://raw․githubusercontent․com/TimTeaFan/loopurrr/twitter-like-badge/likes&label=Likes&query=$.data..public_metrics.like_count&style=social&logo=Twitter`

We can just add this URL to the source attribute of `<img src = …>` in the README.Rmd and the badge
will be rendered on Github as well as on the pkgdown website.
